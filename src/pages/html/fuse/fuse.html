          <h1>What is Fuse?</h1>
          <p>Fuse is an android application that sync's selected files between your android devices without any human interaction(Except the selecting of the files that you want to sync.)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="witc">
          <h1>What is the cost?</h1>
          <p>The app is free! There isn't any cost to use it but you can upgrade your account to sync files that are bigger in size.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="memberships">
          <h1>What are the Upgrades?</h1>
          <p>[$0.00/Month] Can Sync files that are 5MB in size across devices.</p>
          <p>[$9.99/Month] Can Sync files that are 512MB in size across devices.</p>
          <p>[$19.99/Month] Can Sync files that are 5GB(5120MB) in size across devices.</p>
          <p>[$29.99/Month] Can Sync files that are as big as 50GB in size across devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hdiw">
          <h1>How does it work?</h1>
          <P>Each file has a ID to it, that it is matched against your account status, say if you have a $9.99/Month subscription your phone will check to see if the file is 512MB or less in size, if so your phone will send the information to other devices that have the app logged in and on a network connection, through a stable network connection the app will sync the most updated version of the file between all your devices but keeping backups of the other versions of the file(If the file is 25MB or less).</P>
